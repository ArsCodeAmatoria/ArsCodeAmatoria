# Salvete! I am ArsCodeAmatoria

 **"If code is an art, let us be its poets."** – Inspired by Ovid  

 **Programming & Poetry | Ancient Wisdom, Modern Code** 🏛️  
 Crafting elegant solutions with the art of logic and language

## ✨ Ars Codicis: The Art of Code
> *"Principiis obsta; sero medicina paratur..."*  
> ("Resist the beginnings; a cure comes too late...") – Ovid

-  Writing **graceful and structured** code, as Ovid wrote **graceful verse**  
-  Weaving **ancient philosophy** into **modern programming**  
-  Exploring **history, algorithms, and poetic logic** in development

##  Current Scrolls (Projects)
 **Metacode-morphoses** – Transforming mundane scripts into digital poetry  
 **Aeneid.js** – A library for structuring epic journeys in code  
 **Fortuna.py** – A script invoking the whims of chance and fate

##  The Ars Amatoria of Software Craftsmanship
- **"Love your code, but not blindly."** *(Refactor with care!)*  
- **"Teach others, for knowledge shared is knowledge immortalized."**  
- **"Write tests, as the gods wrote fates: unyielding and absolute."**

##  Inspirations
 Ovid’s *Ars Amatoria* – Because **elegance** belongs in both **verse and code**  
 Clean Code – Because **structure** is timeless  
 Algorithms – Because **beauty lies in logic**

> *"Tempus edax rerum" – Time devours all things... but great code endures!*
